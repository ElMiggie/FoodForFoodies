          <li> 1/4 cup Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour </li>
          <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
          <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>
          <li> 1/8 teaspoon salt </li>
          <li> 8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples (8 medium) </li>

      <h4> Directions: <h4>
        <ol>
          <li> Heat oven to 425ºF. Prepare Double-Crust Pastry. </li>
          <li> Mix sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in large bowl. Stir in apples. Turn into pastry-lined pie plate. Dot with butter. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate. </li>
          <li> Roll other round of pastry. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 3-inch strip of aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning. Remove foil during last 15 minutes of baking. </li>
          <li> Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust. Serve warm if desired. </li>
